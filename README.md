## Overview  
This repository contains SQL scripts, queries, and Python code created during the Data Analytics Bootcamp at CareerFoundry and various other data analytic projects. These projects cover various SQL and Python topics, including data manipulation, querying, joins, aggregation, optimization techniques, and data visualization. The exercises and real-world case studies demonstrate the core skills developed throughout the program, with the goal of analyzing and deriving insights from structured data.
